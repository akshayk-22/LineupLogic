# LineupLogic

A data-driven fantasy sports analytics engine that evaluates rosters, trades, and waiver-wire opportunities using statistical modeling and optimization techniques.

---

## 🧠 Overview

LineupLogic is a decision-support platform built to transform fantasy sports league data into structured, quantitative insights.

Rather than relying on intuition, hype-driven narratives, or surface-level statistics, LineupLogic analyzes full league rosters and applies performance modeling, value estimation, and optimization logic to support smarter roster decisions.

The objective is to bring structured analytics and competitive strategy into fantasy sports management.

## 📊 Analytical Framework

LineupLogic evaluates roster decisions using a structured process:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Retrieve league settings, team rosters, and player pools

2. **Value Normalization**
   - Standardize scoring across positions
   - Compute positional scarcity metrics

3. **Marginal Impact Analysis**
   - Estimate performance delta from roster changes
   - Evaluate impact relative to replacement-level players

4. **Optimization Modeling**
   - Apply constraint-based lineup optimization
   - Simulate post-move scoring output

This framework mirrors analytical approaches used in professional sports decision-making.
