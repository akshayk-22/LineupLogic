# LineupLogic

## Overview
This project is a fantasy sports decision-support application designed to analyze league data and provide actionable insights for 
- roster optimization
- trade evaluation
- waiver-wire strategy.

The application integrates league-level data (teams, players, scoring formats) and applies statistical modeling, 
player performance forecasting, and optimization techniques to help users make analytically informed decisions rather than relying on intuition.
